## Why MemLock?

Most people use password managers to store their credentials, but often use weak master passwords to protect them. MemLock solves this problem by creating master passwords that are:

1. **Strong enough** to resist brute force and dictionary attacks
2. **Memorable enough** that you don't need to write them down
3. **Unique** to reduce the risk of credential stuffing attacks

## How to Use

1. Select your preferred password type
2. Adjust the length and character options
3. Click "Generate Password"
4. Use the copy button to copy your new password
5. Recently generated passwords are saved temporarily for convenience

## Installation

No installation required! MemLock runs entirely in your browser.

To host it yourself:

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/daniissac/memlock.git
   ```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser, or host it on any static hosting service like GitHub Pages.

## Privacy & Security

MemLock generates all passwords locally in your browser. No passwords are ever sent to any server or stored permanently. The application uses:

- No external APIs
- No cookies
- No analytics
- No data collection

Recently generated passwords are stored temporarily in your browser's memory and are cleared when you close the tab or browser.

## Security Tips

- Always use different passwords for different accounts
- Regularly update important passwords
- Consider using a reputable password manager alongside MemLock
- For critical accounts, enable two-factor authentication when available

## How MemLock Creates Strong Passwords

### Word-Based Passwords
Combines recognizable words with numbers and special characters to create passwords that are easier to remember but still secure. Example: `Tiger-Flame42!`

### Pattern-Based Passwords
Creates more complex random strings with a mix of characters for maximum security. Example: `j7K#p2Zt@xL9`

### Passphrases
Uses multiple words separated by special characters, which are both highly secure and memorable. Example: `Ocean.Candle.Zebra.123`
